Spectrum: Better SpecIt rendering
=======================================

## Purpose ##

Spectrum is an experiment in SpecIt test result rendering.

SpecIt is pretty, QUnit output less so. Spectrum renders your SpecIt
code to screen, colored to indicate pass/fail status.

## Status ##

The current project is a proof-of-concept. The test output isn't yet as 
informative as QUnit, nor would I call it "pretty" just yet. But the 
SpecIt code can be displayed and colored based on test status, so that's
a start.
